												<h2><strong>Harmonize</strong></h2>
											</header>
											<h3>What is it?</h3>
											<p>
											Harmonize is an app that is designed to be a one stop shop for musicians looking for gigs. It helps musicians connect to event organizers, manage their gigs and calculate gig financials using the in-depth calculator. It was made as a Senior Capstone Project at the University of North Carolina Greensboro. It was selected as the best overall project that semester.
											<br><br>
											Additionally, while the original Harmonize was made as more of a showcase, I made a separate Harmonize Calculator that is fully available to use. It is a spin-off from the larger project, breaking the calculator's functions into its own site.
											<br><br>
											Both projects have video overviews (linked at the bottom of this page) to show their capabilites and how to use them.
											</p>
											<h3>How?</h3>
											<p>
											The idea for Harmonize came about when I was talking with a music professor at my school. They learned I was a computer science major and told me, "I have a great app idea!" Though skeptical, they explained that it is very difficult for a musician to figure out how much they could make from any given gig. They have to account for a lot of things such as travel, taxes, food, housing etc. Doing these extensive calculations by hand is time-consuming, and having a way to easily punch in the numbers and get a result would be extremely useful. The idea intrigued me, and I pitched it to my team as a possible project idea; we fleshed it out and went with it.
											<br><br>
											Harmonize was built using a modified MERN stack, comprising of MySQL, Express, React and Node. For the full Harmonize, the backend server was hosted on Oracle Cloud and the database was hosted on Digital Ocean. For Harmonize Calculator, both the server and database were hosted on Oracle Cloud.
											<br><br>
											The development of the original project took place over a semester (roughly 4 months), with active development not beginning until the middle of the semester. Before ever writing a line of code, the team put together comprehensive documentation outlining the project's functional requirements, database schema and each member's responsibilities.
											<br><br>
											Harmonize consists of two parts. First are events. Event organizers can post events they need musicians for, and musicians can apply to events that fit their needs. Once people have applied to an event, organizers can see their profile, reach out to them before ultimately accepting or rejecting their application. All of this is stored in the users' accounts, making it easy to refer to later. The second is the calculator. It allows musicians to see their hourly wage for any given event after they account for travel, practice hours, taxes etc. They can start from a blank calculator and input their own values or import data directly from events posted on Harmonize. Results can be saved to their account to be revisited at any time or exported to a spreadsheet.Â 
											<br><br>
											Harmonize Calculator is a separate site that was made by isolating the calculator features and fleshing them out. The motivation to do so came from the reception the application got when presenting it. Many people were enthused about the calculator and asked if it would be available. Breaking it off into its own thing made the application much easier to use (i.e., if you only want the calculator, you don't have to use the event features). Some of the additional features added were some extra fields, ability to change defaul values and Google SSO authentication.
											</p>
											<h3>Status</h3>
											<p>
												The original Harmonize is considered complete, and given it was made for a school project is unlikely to get any updates. It is hosted at <a href="https://harmonize.rocks" target="_blank">this link</a> if you would like to try it.
												<br><br>
												Harmonize Calculator on the other hand is a much smaller application and will be maintained for the forseeable future. Depending on how much usage it gets, I plan to keep bug fixing and adding features to make it a useful tool for any musicians who wish to use it. You can find it at <a href="https://harmnize.com" target="_blank">this link.</a>
